Readme for Space Shooter(Python & Pygame)

Description

Space Shooter is a 2D arcade-style shooting game developed using Python and the Pygame library. The player controls a spaceship and must destroy incoming enemy ships while avoiding collisions. The game features multiple enemy types, weapon upgrades, power-ups, sound effects, and wave-based difficulty progression.
This project demonstrates core game development concepts such as object-oriented programming, sprite-based collision detection, real-time game loops, and audio integration.

Gameplay Overview

1.Control a spaceship using keyboard inputs
2.Shoot enemies and score points
3.Collect power-ups to upgrade weapons or restore health
4.Survive increasingly difficult enemy waves
5.Restart the game after Game Over

Features

1.Smooth player movement and shooting mechanics
